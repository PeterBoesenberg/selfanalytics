If you ever want to change the English text, you also have to search for every occurrence of it in your code - annoying.Adding another ""technical"" language, which you will never adjust but only use for reference in your code makes your life a lot easier:""translation"": [      {""key"": ""app.welcome"", ""en"": ""Hello Shiny!"", ""pl"": ""Witaj Shiny!""}]Your R code will be using only the technical keys and never ""real"" language.

If it is a function with let's say three lines, it gets one or several unit tests. But what do you do, if it is a private function inside of an R6Class? There are ways to access private functions from outside. But the real question is: Should you?I say: Don't test it, don't test any private functions.1. Only public functions really matter.Your public functions should always and safely return the correct results. That is the only important thing. Don't waste your time on unimportant things.2. Write enough tests to trust your code.You could argue, that you can have more trust in your code, when you test every little piece on its own, even private functions. If this is your concern, you should more likely start to redesign your classes. Write more classes, instead of big classes. Think about writing a more generlazied public interface of your class.Think more about what should be publicly accessible from this class, not about what do I need right now.What do you thing about testing private and public functions?#unittesting #r #codequality",Text,6,8,2d,1262,https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterboesenberg/,2020-11-15T13:54:11.581Z

Was ein #DataScientist alles können soll, lese ich hier auf LinkedIn immer wieder. - Statistik- Datenanalyse- Visualisierung- Machine Learning- Algorithmen benutzen, tunen, selbst entwickeln- #R oder #python, gerne auch beides, je nach den Umständen- Excel, #SQL und #Tableau wären auch schönDaneben wäre es prima, wenn sich der Data Scientist mit er neuesten Forschung im Bereich von KI, Algorithmen, Statistik und gern auch ein Schuss Psychologie auf dem Laufenden hält. Finde ich sogar überzeugend und stimme ich zu.Letztendlich ist es gar nicht so wichtig, ob ich nun in jedem Bereich eine große Leuchte bin.

Diese Woche habe zwei Data.Tables zusammengefügt, also gejoined. Daher habe ich mal geschaut, ob Data.Tables auch beim JOIN schneller sind. Dafür habe ich das Beispiel aus dem Screenshot verwendet. Ich habe zufällig 100000 Datensätze generiert mit Personen und Adressen und die mit Data.Table und Data.Frame zusammengefügt.Dabei ist folgendes herausgekommen:system.time(dt[dt_adress])       User      System verstrichen        0.02        0.00        0.02 system.time(merge(df,df_adress,by=""name""))       User      System verstrichen        0.49        0.00        0.48 Schon bei diesen kleinen Datensätzen ist Data.Table dem DataFrame haushoch überlegen. 0.02 Sekunden beim Data.Table-Join gegenüber 0.48 Sekunden beim DataFrame-Join spricht eine deutliche Sprache.

Ich habe den #DataScientist mit #R bei DataCamp abgeschlossen. Im groben Überblick waren das die Inhalte der 19 Kurse:- R-Basics- R-Advanced- Tidyverse- Datenmanipulation mit dplyr- Datenvisualisierung mit ggplot- Datenimport - Data-Cleaning- Datum und Zeit in R- Funktionen in R- Korrelationen und Regression- Supervised Learning (Log., DecisionTrees, Random Forest, xgboost)- Unsupervised Learning (Hierchisches Cluster, K-Means, PCA)- Cluster-AnalyseGelernt habe ich vor allem, dass es für praktisch alles bereits ein R-Package gibt. Die Anwendung gerade im Supervised-Learning-Bereich ist ziemlich einheitlich. Der steilste Teil meiner Lernkurve war und ist, das richtige Package für den aktuellen Einsatzzweck zu verwenden. Dafür haben die Kurse sehr viel gebracht! Im Alltag benutze ich dann für einen Großteil der Datenmanipulation statt dplyr dann doch lieber DataTable und für die Visualisierung lieber #Plotly statt ggplot.

Herzlich Willkommen im neuen Jahr 2019 liebe  Mitdenkenden! Unsere beliebte #OKR - Infoveranstaltung findet wieder statt. Wer noch nichts über #OKR gehört hat, hier in Kürze: Bei OKR handelt es sich um eine innovative Führungsmethode, die sich der Hilfe inspirierender Ziele bedient. Dabei wird jedem Ziel (Objective) messbare Schlüsselergebnisse  (Key Results) zugeordnet. OKR kann als Framework verstanden werden, deren Eckpfeiler Fokus, Transparenz und Mitarbeiterbeteiligung darstellen. Da für uns bei OKR der Mitarbeiter selbst das Herzstück des Leitbilds darstellt, entsteht eine Motivation, die auf einer geteilten Leidenschaft für eine Vision und einer gemeinsamen Zielrichtung basiert.Also herzlich Willkommen am 30.01 um 18 Uhr in Hannover. #NewWork #Agiel Weitere Information hier:https://lnkd.in/d3beaTn",Image,0,0,1yr,,https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterboesenberg/,2020-11-15T13:54:11.587Z
